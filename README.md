> **"The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine."** - J.B.S. Haldane

Have you ever wondered what happens when two particles collide at near-light speed? How electrons really behave in an atom? What the probability cloud of a hydrogen orbital looks like in 3D? Or dreamed of running your own physics experiments to explore the fundamental nature of reality?

**Cosmium makes quantum physics experimentation accessible to everyone.**

Whether you're a curious student, self-taught physics enthusiast, educator, or researcher, Cosmium provides the tools to create, run, and visualize quantum mechanical experiments without needing a physics degree or access to million-dollar laboratory equipment.

## 🎯 Vision

Cosmium was born from a simple belief: **the wonder of quantum physics shouldn't be locked behind academic barriers.** 

We're building a comprehensive simulation engine that democratizes access to quantum mechanical experimentation, enabling anyone with curiosity and a computer to:

- **Explore** the fundamental particles and forces that govern our universe
- **Experiment** with quantum phenomena through accurate simulations
- **Visualize** complex quantum states, wave functions, and particle interactions
- **Discover** new insights about quantum mechanics through hands-on experimentation
- **Learn** physics concepts through interactive exploration rather than passive reading

Who knows? The next breakthrough in quantum physics might come from a curious mind experimenting with Cosmium in their bedroom, not a traditional laboratory.
